# Design-pattern
<i>In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.</i>

<i>A Design patterns are used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced object-oriented software developers.</i>

<i>Using design patterns can make code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable. </i>

<i>Design patterns donâ€™t solve the problem themselves, they help us solve the problem.</i>

## Purpose of Design Patterns

<p>You are building a house yourself without any plan. You have a rough idea of what you want or need for the house and you start building the first wall, then the second wall and so on. Sooner you find out that this is not going to work and it can be more problematic if you are building the house with multiple people. How will they know what to do without a plan? The same thing goes for software. 
In software development, you can build an application without upfront design. Especially if you can re-use an existing design. (e.g. adding a new page to a website does not require you to re-design everything. You can just follow how other pages were made and re-use the same build pattern). You can check the existing solution for the similar kind of problem you are dealing with and use the technique or use some code from there to solve your own problems<p> 

## Types of Design Patterns

### 1.Creational:
<p>Creational patterns are all about <b>class instantiation </b>or <b>object creation</b>. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done. </p>

### 2.Structural:
<p>These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.</p>

### 3.Behavioral:
<p> Most of these design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects</p>
